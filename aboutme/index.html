    <p>
      I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Science in Software
      Development. Music is a big part of my life, and I enjoy playing the
      guitar, drums, bass, and piano. In addition to music, I am passionate
      about sports, particularly soccer, and I have a deep love for dogs and
      canine psychology.

      My interest in IT has been fueled by my fascination with cybersecurity and
      web development. I am eager to combine these interests with my software
      development studies to build a fulfilling career. I am currently seeking
      my first opportunity in the IT field, transitioning from a background in
      the bakery and pastry industry.

      Through my education, I aim to gain the skills and knowledge necessary to
      excel in the dynamic field of software development. I believe that my
      diverse interests and past experiences will contribute to a unique
      perspective and a well-rounded approach to my future career in IT.
